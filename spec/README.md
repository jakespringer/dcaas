# The formal specification of Data Collection as a Service (DCaaS)

## Abstract

This application is intended to replace the antiquated methods of diary data collection by
replacing it with a fast, secure, intuitive system that provides the following services:

1. Easy, powerful drag-and-drop tool to create user-friendly surveys
2. Secure, provably anonymous data collection via the surveys
3. Data storage via a relational database, editable through an easy-to-use user interface
4. Data exporting, including to formats supported by SAS

## Rationale

Currently, there does not exist any satisfactory software that manages data collection for
researchers. This software will allow researchers to emerge from the dark ages and collect
data as should be done in the modern age.
